- PHP 5 or latest
- MySQL 5 or latest
- PHP5-mysql driver


OPTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

INSTALLATION
------------


0. SETUP WEB SERVER & MYSQL DATABASE SERVER

   Openevsys is a web based system which require php5 enabled web-server. If you
do not have a web server already setup-ed in your system you need to do so. We
would recommend to to use Apache2 which you can download from following url
http://httpd.apache.org/ . You would also need PHP5 installed on your web server
which you can download from http://www.php.net/ site. Like wise you need to have
MYSQL 5 database server running on your system which you can download from
http://www.mysql.com/.

LINUX   : If you are a linux user please use the local package manager of your
          system to install the above software.

WINDOWS : If you are a windows user we would recommend to use XAMPP instead of
          installing the above software separately.



1. EXTRACT APPLICATION

   Extract the application to a directory of your preference and create a link to
"www" folder from document root of the web server. For security reasons you should
only expose the "www" to the web and keep the rest of the directories out of the
document root.



2. GRANT DIRECTORY PERMISSIONS

   You need to provide write access to the following directories.

APPROOT/media - This is where the uploaded documents will get saved.

APPROOT/conf  - The web installer needs write access to this directory to create the
                configuration file.

APPROOT/res/locale  - You need to give permission to this directory if you are using
                      the application features to translate and manage languages.



3. RUN THE WEB INSTALLER

   Access the www directory using a web browser and run the web installer.


4. CHANGE PERMISSION OF SYSCONF

   Once the application is installed through web installer please change the permission
of sysconf.php file in conf directory to read only. This will make sure the configuration
file cannot be change by accessing through web server.


BACKUP / RESTORE feature
-------------------------

The backup and restore feature allows you to either export your OpenEvSys database
as an sql file, or to import an sql file into your database. Restoring the database
from a backup this way is a destructive operation that replaces your existing data
with the imported one, this is intended to be used for syncing to instances to have
the same data.

To enable these features set the $conf['enable_backup_restore'] setting to true in 
the config file. They also require access to your `mysql` and `mysqldump` commands,
if they're not in your system PATH environment variable, then specify their
locations in the `$conf['mysql_bin_path']` and `$conf['mysqldump_bin_path]` settings.

Furthermore, you will need to make the `db_restore` directory writable. That's where
the backup.sql file, migration log and temp files are stored.
